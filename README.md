You have to use your own token.  My token will expire and you will receive error 401.

1. Go to requestApplication => Builder.ts and change token where I left a comment.
2. Download this project and open it in terminal.
3. Type npm i --save-dev @types/mocha
4. Type npm test

Please, write me in google class if you would have any issues.
